@article{Peters.2018,
 abstract = {Individuals with severe speech and physical impairments may have concomitant visual acuity impairments (VAI) or ocular motility impairments (OMI) impacting visual BCI use. We report on the use of the Shuffle Speller typing interface for an SSVEP BCI copy-spelling task under three conditions: simulated VAI, simulated OMI, and unimpaired vision. To mitigate the effect of visual impairments, we introduce a method that adaptively selects a user-specific trial length to maximize expected information transfer rate (ITR); expected ITR is shown to closely approximate the rate of correct letter selections. All participants could type under the unimpaired and simulated VAI conditions, with no significant differences in typing accuracy or speed. Most participants (31 of 37) could not type under the simulated OMI condition; some achieved high accuracy but with slower typing speeds. Reported workload and discomfort were low, and satisfaction high, under the unimpaired and simulated VAI conditions. Implications and future directions to examine effect of visual impairment on BCI use is discussed.},

@article{Mowla.2017,
 abstract = {Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer restoration of communication to those with the most severe movement impairments, but performance is not yet ideal. Previous work has demonstrated that latency jitter, the variation in timing of the brain responses, plays a critical role in determining BCI performance. In this study, we used Classifier-Based Latency Estimation (CBLE) and a wavelet transform to provide information about latency jitter to a second-level classifier. Three second-level classifiers were tested: least squares (LS), step-wise linear discriminant analysis (SWLDA), and support vector machine (SVM). Of these three, LS and SWLDA performed better than the original online classifier. The resulting combination demonstrated improved detection of brain responses for many participants, resulting in better BCI performance. Interestingly, the performance gain was greatest for those individuals for whom the BCI did not work well online, indicating that this method may be most suitable for improving performance of otherwise marginal participants.},

@article{Speier.2018,
 abstract = {The P300 Speller Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) provides a means of communication for those suffering from advanced neuromuscular diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Recent literature has incorporated language-based modelling, which uses previously chosen characters and the structure of natural language to modify the interface and classifier. Two complementary methods of incorporating language models have previously been independently studied: predictive spelling uses language models to generate suggestions of complete words to allow for the selection of multiple characters simultaneously, and language model-based classifiers have used prior characters to create a prior probability distribution over the characters based on how likely they are to follow. In this study, we propose a combined method which extends a language-based classifier to generate prior probabilities for both individual characters and complete words. In order to gauge the efficiency of this new model, results across 12 healthy subjects were measured. Incorporating predictive spelling increased typing speed using the P300 speller, with an average increase of 15.5{\%} in typing rate across subjects, demonstrating that language models can be effectively utilized to create full word suggestions for predictive spelling. When combining predictive spelling with language model classification, typing speed is significantly improved, resulting in better typing performance.},

 abstract = {The P300 speller is a common brain-computer interface system that can provide a means of communication for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Recent studies have shown that incorporating language information in signal classification can improve system performance, but they have largely been tested on healthy volunteers in a laboratory setting. The goal of this study was to demonstrate the functionality of the P300 speller system with language models when used by ALS patients in their homes. Six ALS patients with functional ratings ranging from two to 28 participated in this study. All subjects had improved offline performance when using a language model and five subjects were able to type at least six characters per minute with over 84{\%} accuracy in online sessions. The results of this study indicate that the improvements in performance using language models in the P300 speller translate into the ALS population, which could help to make it a viable assistive device.},

There is an emphasis on balancing the back-end concern with usability and engineering excellence (getting the design right) with an up-front investment in sketching and ideation (getting the right design).

 abstract = {In order to design brain-computer interface applications based on steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP), one has to decide on the shape, the attributes and the way the SSVEP stimuli are to be displayed to the user. This choice is generally driven by the tasks to achieve and, eventually, the complexity of the systems to be controlled. An ?object-affordance centric? approach consists in ?ickering objects of interest that appear in the ?eld of view of the user during video feedback, e.g. provided by a robotic surrogate embedded with cameras. Processing of the video images automatically recognizes objects of interest that are in the user?s ?eld of view. These are overlapped with graphical icons that ?icker at different frequencies to be recognized by the SSVEP-BCI classi?er. This study investigates selected graphical and rendering practices that affect the strength of the SSVEP to produce the highest performance during BCI operations.},

@article{Golding.2006,
 abstract = {Motion sickness can be caused by a variety of motion environments (e.g., cars, boats, planes, tilting trains, funfair rides, space, virtual reality) and given a sufficiently provocative motion stimulus almost anyone with a functioning vestibular system can be made motion sick. Current hypotheses of the 'Why?' of motion sickness are still under investigation, the two most important being 'toxin detector' and the 'vestibular-cardiovascular reflex'. By contrast, the 'How?' of motion sickness is better understood in terms of mechanisms (e.g., 'sensory conflict' or similar) and stimulus properties (e.g., acceleration, frequency, duration, visual-vestibular time-lag). Factors governing motion sickness susceptibility may be divided broadly into two groups: (i) those related to the stimulus (motion type and provocative property of stimulus); and (ii) those related to the individual person (habituation or sensitisation, individual differences, protective behaviours, administration of anti-motion sickness drugs). The aim of this paper is to review some of the more important factors governing motion sickness susceptibility, with an emphasis on the personal rather than physical stimulus factors.},

@article{Huggins.2016,
 abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are intended to provide independent communication for those with the most severe physical impairments. However, development and testing of BCIs is typically conducted with copy-spelling of provided text, which models only a small portion of a functional communication task. This study was designed to determine how BCI performance is affected by novel text generation. We used a within-subject single-session study design in which subjects used a BCI to perform copy-spelling of provided text and to generate self-composed text to describe a picture. Additional off-line analysis was performed to identify changes in the event-related potentials that the BCI detects and to examine the effects of training the BCI classifier on task-specific data. Accuracy was reduced during the picture description task; (t(8)=2.59 p=0.0321). Creating the classifier using self-generated text data significantly improved accuracy on these data; (t(7)=-2.68, p=0.0317), but did not bring performance up to the level achieved during copy-spelling. Thus, this study shows that the task for which the BCI is used makes a difference in BCI accuracy. Task-specific BCI classifiers are a first step to counteract this effect, but additional study is needed.},
