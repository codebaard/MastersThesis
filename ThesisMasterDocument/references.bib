@article{Peters.2018,
 abstract = {Individuals with severe speech and physical impairments may have concomitant visual acuity impairments (VAI) or ocular motility impairments (OMI) impacting visual BCI use. We report on the use of the Shuffle Speller typing interface for an SSVEP BCI copy-spelling task under three conditions: simulated VAI, simulated OMI, and unimpaired vision. To mitigate the effect of visual impairments, we introduce a method that adaptively selects a user-specific trial length to maximize expected information transfer rate (ITR); expected ITR is shown to closely approximate the rate of correct letter selections. All participants could type under the unimpaired and simulated VAI conditions, with no significant differences in typing accuracy or speed. Most participants (31 of 37) could not type under the simulated OMI condition; some achieved high accuracy but with slower typing speeds. Reported workload and discomfort were low, and satisfaction high, under the unimpaired and simulated VAI conditions. Implications and future directions to examine effect of visual impairment on BCI use is discussed.},

@article{Mowla.2017,
 abstract = {Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer restoration of communication to those with the most severe movement impairments, but performance is not yet ideal. Previous work has demonstrated that latency jitter, the variation in timing of the brain responses, plays a critical role in determining BCI performance. In this study, we used Classifier-Based Latency Estimation (CBLE) and a wavelet transform to provide information about latency jitter to a second-level classifier. Three second-level classifiers were tested: least squares (LS), step-wise linear discriminant analysis (SWLDA), and support vector machine (SVM). Of these three, LS and SWLDA performed better than the original online classifier. The resulting combination demonstrated improved detection of brain responses for many participants, resulting in better BCI performance. Interestingly, the performance gain was greatest for those individuals for whom the BCI did not work well online, indicating that this method may be most suitable for improving performance of otherwise marginal participants.},

@article{Martins.2019,
 abstract = {The Internet comprises a decentralized global system that serves humanity's collective effort to generate, process, and store data, most of which is handled by the rapidly expanding cloud. A stable, secure, real-time system may allow for interfacing the cloud with the human brain. One promising strategy for enabling such a system, denoted here as a {\textquotedbl}human brain/cloud interface{\textquotedbl} ({\textquotedbl}B/CI{\textquotedbl}), would be based on technologies referred to here as {\textquotedbl}neuralnanorobotics.{\textquotedbl} Future neuralnanorobotics technologies are anticipated to facilitate accurate diagnoses and eventual cures for the $\sim$400 conditions that affect the human brain. Neuralnanorobotics may also enable a B/CI with controlled connectivity between neural activity and external data storage and processing, via the direct monitoring of the brain's $\sim$86 $\times$ 109 neurons and $\sim$2 $\times$ 1014 synapses. Subsequent to navigating the human vasculature, three species of neuralnanorobots (endoneurobots, gliabots, and synaptobots) could traverse the blood-brain barrier (BBB), enter the brain parenchyma, ingress into individual human brain cells, and autoposition themselves at the axon initial segments of neurons (endoneurobots), within glial cells (gliabots), and in intimate proximity to synapses (synaptobots). They would then wirelessly transmit up to $\sim$6 $\times$ 1016 bits per second of synaptically processed and encoded human-brain electrical information via auxiliary nanorobotic fiber optics (30 cm3) with the capacity to handle up to 1018 bits/sec and provide rapid data transfer to a cloud based supercomputer for real-time brain-state monitoring and data extraction. A neuralnanorobotically enabled human B/CI might serve as a personalized conduit, allowing persons to obtain direct, instantaneous access to virtually any facet of cumulative human knowledge. Other anticipated applications include myriad opportunities to improve education, intelligence, entertainment, traveling, and other interactive experiences. A specialized application might be the capacity to engage in fully immersive experiential/sensory experiences, including what is referred to here as {\textquotedbl}transparent shadowing{\textquotedbl} (TS). Through TS, individuals might experience episodic segments of the lives of other willing participants (locally or remote) to, hopefully, encourage and inspire improved understanding and tolerance among all members of the human family.},

 abstract = {Humans can learn to control the amplitude of electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in specific frequency bands over sensorimotor cortex and use it to move a cursor to a target on a computer screen. EEG-based communication could provide a new augmentative communication channel for individuals with motor disabilities. In the present system, each dimension of cursor movement is controlled by a linear equation. While the intercept in the equation is continually updated, it does not perfectly eliminate the impact of spontaneous variations in EEG amplitude. This imperfection reduces the accuracy of cursor movement. We evaluated a response verification (RV) procedure in which each outcome is determined by two opposite trials (e.g., one top-target trial and one bottom-target trial). Success, or failure, on both is required for a definitive outcome. The RV procedure reduces errors due to imperfection in intercept selection. Accuracy for opposite-trial pairs exceeds that predicted from the accuracies of individual trials, and greatly exceeds that for same-trial pairs. The RV procedure should be particularly valuable when the first trial has {\textgreater}2 possible targets, because the second trial need only confirm or deny the outcome of the first, and it should be applicable to nonlinear as well as to linear algorithms.},

Recent studies have shown that incorporating language information in signal classification can improve system performance, but they have largely been tested on healthy volunteers in a laboratory setting. The goal of this study was to demonstrate the functionality of the P300 speller system with language models when used by ALS patients in their homes. Six ALS patients with functional ratings ranging from two to 28 participated in this study. All subjects had improved offline performance when using a language model and five subjects were able to type at least six characters per minute with over 84{\%} accuracy in online sessions. The results of this study indicate that the improvements in performance using language models in the P300 speller translate into the ALS population, which could help to make it a viable assistive device.},

 abstract = {The P300 Speller Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) provides a means of communication for those suffering from advanced neuromuscular diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Recent literature has incorporated language-based modelling, which uses previously chosen characters and the structure of natural language to modify the interface and classifier. Two complementary methods of incorporating language models have previously been independently studied: predictive spelling uses language models to generate suggestions of complete words to allow for the selection of multiple characters simultaneously, and language model-based classifiers have used prior characters to create a prior probability distribution over the characters based on how likely they are to follow. In this study, we propose a combined method which extends a language-based classifier to generate prior probabilities for both individual characters and complete words. In order to gauge the efficiency of this new model, results across 12 healthy subjects were measured. Incorporating predictive spelling increased typing speed using the P300 speller, with an average increase of 15.5{\%} in typing rate across subjects, demonstrating that language models can be effectively utilized to create full word suggestions for predictive spelling. When combining predictive spelling with language model classification, typing speed is significantly improved, resulting in better typing performance.},

@article{Yuan.2013,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

Today, the brain-computer interface (BCI) community lacks a standard method to evaluate an online BCI's performance. Even the most commonly used metric, the information transfer rate (ITR), is often reported differently, even incorrectly, in many papers, which is not conducive to BCI research. This paper aims to point out many of the existing problems and give some suggestions and methods to overcome these problems.

APPROACH

First, the preconditions inherent in ITR calculation based on Wolpaw's definition are summarized and several incorrect ITR calculations, which go against the preconditions, are indicated. Then, the issues affecting ITR estimation during the test of online BCI systems are discussed in detail. Finally, a task-oriented online BCI test platform was proposed, which may help BCI evaluations in real-world applications.

MAIN RESULTS

The guidelines for ITR calculation in online BCIs testing are proposed. The platform executed in the Beijing BCI Competition 2010 shows that it can be used as a common way to compare the online performances (including the ITR) of existing BCI paradigms.

SIGNIFICANCE

The proposed guidelines and task-oriented test platform may reduce the uncertainty and artifacts of online BCI performance evaluation; they provide a relatively objective way to compare different BCI's performances in real-world BCI applications, which is a forward step toward developing standards for BCI performance evaluation.},

 abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are intended to provide independent communication for those with the most severe physical impairments. However, development and testing of BCIs is typically conducted with copy-spelling of provided text, which models only a small portion of a functional communication task. This study was designed to determine how BCI performance is affected by novel text generation. We used a within-subject single-session study design in which subjects used a BCI to perform copy-spelling of provided text and to generate self-composed text to describe a picture. Additional off-line analysis was performed to identify changes in the event-related potentials that the BCI detects and to examine the effects of training the BCI classifier on task-specific data. Accuracy was reduced during the picture description task; (t(8)=2.59 p=0.0321). Creating the classifier using self-generated text data significantly improved accuracy on these data; (t(7)=-2.68, p=0.0317), but did not bring performance up to the level achieved during copy-spelling. Thus, this study shows that the task for which the BCI is used makes a difference in BCI accuracy. Task-specific BCI classifiers are a first step to counteract this effect, but additional study is needed.},

Neural probes for recording neural signals are among the essential components of a BMI system. In this report, we review research regarding implantable neural probes and their applications to BMIs. We first discuss conventional neural probes such as the tetrode, Utah array, Michigan probe, and electroencephalography (ECoG), following which we cover advancements in next-generation neural probes. These next-generation probes are associated with improvements in electrical properties, mechanical durability, biocompatibility, and offer a high degree of freedom in practical settings. Specifically, we focus on three key topics: (1) novel implantable neural probes that decrease the level of invasiveness without sacrificing performance, (2) multi-modal neural probes that measure both electrical and optical signals, (3) and neural probes developed using advanced materials. Because safety and precision are critical for practical applications of BMI systems, future studies should aim to enhance these properties when developing next-generation neural probes.},

 abstract = {Human sensory and motor systems provide the natural means for the exchange of information between individuals, and, hence, the basis for human civilization. The recent development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) has provided an important element for the creation of brain-to-brain communication systems, and precise brain stimulation techniques are now available for the realization of non-invasive computer-brain interfaces (CBI). These technologies, BCI and CBI, can be combined to realize the vision of non-invasive, computer-mediated brain-to-brain (B2B) communication between subjects (hyperinteraction). Here we demonstrate the conscious transmission of information between human brains through the intact scalp and without intervention of motor or peripheral sensory systems. Pseudo-random binary streams encoding words were transmitted between the minds of emitter and receiver subjects separated by great distances, representing the realization of the first human brain-to-brain interface. In a series of experiments, we established internet-mediated B2B communication by combining a BCI based on voluntary motor imagery-controlled electroencephalographic (EEG) changes with a CBI inducing the conscious perception of phosphenes (light flashes) through neuronavigated, robotized transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), with special care taken to block sensory (tactile, visual or auditory) cues. Our results provide a critical proof-of-principle demonstration for the development of conscious B2B communication technologies. More fully developed, related implementations will open new research venues in cognitive, social and clinical neuroscience and the scientific study of consciousness. We envision that hyperinteraction technologies will eventually have a profound impact on the social structure of our civilization and raise important ethical issues.},

Current hypotheses of the 'Why?' of motion sickness are still under investigation, the two most important being 'toxin detector' and the 'vestibular-cardiovascular reflex'. By contrast, the 'How?' of motion sickness is better understood in terms of mechanisms (e.g., 'sensory conflict' or similar) and stimulus properties (e.g., acceleration, frequency, duration, visual-vestibular time-lag). Factors governing motion sickness susceptibility may be divided broadly into two groups: (i) those related to the stimulus (motion type and provocative property of stimulus); and (ii) those related to the individual person (habituation or sensitisation, individual differences, protective behaviours, administration of anti-motion sickness drugs). The aim of this paper is to review some of the more important factors governing motion sickness susceptibility, with an emphasis on the personal rather than physical stimulus factors.},
